# Gap Filling of High-Resolution Soil Moisture for SMAP/Sentinel-1: A Two-Layer Machine Learning-Based Framework
Code for paper [Gap Filling of High-Resolution Soil Moisture for SMAP/Sentinel-1: A Two-Layer Machine Learning-Based Framework
](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR024902). An open access version of the paper can be found [here](https://eartharxiv.org/ce865/).

## Data Preprocessing
Code for data preprocessing is contained in folder **data_preprocessing**. Functions are then called by generate_experiment_data.py to generate experiment data. 

Data from various sources are first converted to a unified format [netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html) with their original resolutions being kept. They are then rescaled to have the same resolution as the SMAP/Sentinel-1 3 km soil moisture product. More details can be found in the paper.
